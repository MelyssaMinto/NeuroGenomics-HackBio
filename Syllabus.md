# Syllabus

## Course Overview

ðŸ’¡ This course will aim to cover transcriptions and neuronal plasticity. Basic knowledge of R , linux command line, and and rudimentary statistics background are required. The learning objectives include:

- Sequence alignment
- Introduction to transcriptomics
- Overview of neuronal plasticity

ðŸ’¡ In this course we will learn how to use [DESeq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html) to perform differential expression analysis and other tools to perform functional enrichment. We will also explore neuronal transcriptomics databases such as the [Allen Brain Atlas](https://portal.brain-map.org/). 

ðŸ’¡ Each class will have a pre-assesment and video lecture that are to be completed before the live course.

## ðŸ’»Class set up

- Git clone/download [this repo](https://github.com/MelyssaMinto/NeuroGenomics-HackBio) for course materials
- Install these packages in your respective RStudio Server instance

```r
# installing packages from the CRAN repo
install.packages('tidyverse')
install.packages('reshape2')
install.packages('dendextend')

# Installing packages from the Bioconductor repo
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("DESeq2")
BiocManager::install("TxDb.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10.knownGene")
BiocManager::install("org.Mm.eg.db")
BiocManager::install("clusterProfiler")
BiocManager::install("ReactomePA")

```

## ðŸš§Troubleshooting

You will run into technical issues during this class, just as any Bioinformatician would. It is very important to understand how to troubleshoot these issues. When running into an error 

1. Read the error message to discern what the problem is 
2. Read the man file or help page for the tool you are trouble shooting 
3. Google it 
4. Ask your peers in the slack channel for the course 
5. Ask me for help
